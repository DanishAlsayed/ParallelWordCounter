# ParallelWordCounter
Four C programs – One Sequentioan, two are multiprocessing programs and one multithreaded program – to count the frequencies of the selected keywords in a document

This was one of my university projects. It demonstrated doing the same tast i.e. counting the frequency of words in a given document using simple sequential, multiprocessing and multithreading techniques.

wordcnt0.c --> sequential (Provide File I/O, counting logics)
wordcnt1.c --> simple multiprocessing (Process Management, Process Communication)
wordcnt2.c --> coordinated multiprocessing (Process Synchronization using Signals, Process Termination)
wordcnt3.c --> coordinated multithreading (Threads Management, Synchronization, Producer/consumer interaction)
